# Learning Paths
Learning pathways for SBA engineering roles.  This repository captures a quick reference for the skillsets and technologies we need to build in order to train engineers in four different disciplines:

- [Backend Developers](backend-developer/README.md)
- [DevOps Engineers](devops-engineer/README.md)
- [Frontend Developers](frontend-developer/README.md)
- [Security Engineers](security-engineer/README.md)

Each discipline above has a roadmap or set of focus areas.
